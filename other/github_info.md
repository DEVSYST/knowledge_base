### Github pull request - correct steps:

 0. develop is the main base branch for pull request.
 1. Create your own branch for developing. for example branch01.
 2. After developing create a new branch from your branch (branch01 is base branch). for example branch02.
 3. on branch02 make rebase from develop branch. for example git rebase origin develop
 4. If any conflicts - resolve conflicts.
 5. Make a force push from branch02.
 6. Create pull request

the above instruction will soon be updated with specific commands.
